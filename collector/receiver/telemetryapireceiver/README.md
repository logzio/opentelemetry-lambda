This receiver generates telemetry in response to events from the [AWS Lambda Telemetry API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/telemetry-api.html). It runs as a Lambda Extension, setting up an endpoint and registering itself with the Telemetry API on startup to convert platform and function events into OpenTelemetry signals.

### Supported Events

The receiver processes events from the Telemetry API and converts them as follows:

  * **Metrics**: `platform.report` events are converted into OTel Gauge metrics. This includes key performance indicators like `durationMs`, `billedDurationMs`, `memorySizeMB`, and `maxMemoryUsedMB`.
  * **Traces**: Lifecycle events are used to create spans:
      * `platform.initStart` and `platform.initRuntimeDone` are used to create a span for the function initialization phase (cold start).
      * `platform.start` and `platform.runtimeDone` are used to create a span for the function invocation phase.
  * **Logs**: `function` and `extension` events are converted into OTel Log records, preserving the original message, timestamp, and severity.

## Configuration

The following settings can be configured:

| Field       | Default                                 | Description                                                                                                                                    |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `port`      | `4325`                                  | The HTTP server port to receive Telemetry API data.                                                                                             |
| `types`     | `["platform", "function", "extension"]` | The [types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/telemetry-api-reference.html#telemetry-subscribe-api) of telemetry to subscribe to. |
| `maxItems`  | `1000`                                  | The maximum number of events to buffer in Lambda's memory before sending.                                                                       |
| `maxBytes`  | `262144`                                | The maximum size (in bytes) of events to buffer in Lambda's memory before sending.                                                              |
| `timeoutMs` | `1000`                                  | The maximum time (in milliseconds) to buffer events before sending.                                                                            |
